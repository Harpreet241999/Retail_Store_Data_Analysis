1. Customer Base Overview

A total of 3,900 customers visited the store during the period analyzed.
68% of customers are male and 32% are female → The store should continue prioritizing male-focused inventory, while still keeping a meaningful range of female items due to the significant minority segment.

2. Seasonal Trends & Stocking Guidance

Seasonal purchase patterns indicate distinct preferences:
Fall: Jackets, hats, handbags
Spring: Sweaters, shorts, blouses (also coat, skirt)
Summer: Pants, dresses, jewelry, shoes
Winter: Sunglasses, pants, shirts
Recommendation: Adjust ordering and display planning to highlight category trends per season.

3. Most Active Shopping Season

Spring recorded the highest number of total purchases (999), followed by Fall and Winter.
Summer had the fewest purchases.
Recommendation: Increase inventory depth, staff availability, and promotional campaigns leading into Spring.


4. Stocking Should Vary by Location

Location-based customer mix reveals notable differences.
Montana, for example, has the largest customer base, with male customers dominating in most regions.
Recommendation: Adopt region-specific assortment planning rather than one national allocation model.

5. Top Locations for Customer Experience

Locations such as Illinois, Alabama, and Montana demonstrate:
Higher average customer review ratings
Stronger repeat visit (loyalty) activity
Recommendation: Benchmark these stores’ operating practices, customer service routines, and merchandising layouts to improve underperforming locations.

6. Repeat Shopping Behavior Drives Revenue

Customers with more than 10 previous purchases consistently spend more on new transactions compared to customers with fewer past visits.
Recommendation: Increase focus on loyalty programs, personalized offers, and VIP perks to nurture high-value customers and encourage repeat buying behavior.
